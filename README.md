## Our process
### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS
-  Desktop-first workflow
-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

### What we learned

-  [AK] - Feedback from [Veronika](#authors) about the part of the project that I coded has made me think more about building for scalability. I was able to implement her suggestions on making the styles for the ratings section applicable to any number of items in the section.

### Continued development

-  [AK] - I want to build future projects with scalability in mind, and also, to focus on making the projects efficient in terms of performance.

### Useful resources

-  [AK] - I use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) SVG Editor all the time when I'm working on any web project. For this project, I loaded the project designs into Inkscape and used it's in-built tools to figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project.

-  [AK] - To better understand how I approached coding the project using Inkscape, have a look at this repository I made - [Designing and Coding Layouts](https://github.com/AllanKirui/designing-and-coding-layouts)
